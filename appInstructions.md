**Application Instructions**

Choose the dependent variable from the drop down box and the independent variable(s) by checking the box next to their names.  In the `Regression Summary` tab, you will find the linear regression output in a table, just as you would in **R**.

If you check the factoring option, the variables marked with a `[1]` in the list above will be treated as a factor.  

If you have a regression in place and click on the factoring option, your choices -- and the regression model they created -- will be reset.

In the `Regression Plot` tab, you will see the plot of the regression you created with the dependent variable on the y-axis and the independent variable(s) on the x-axis.  Also, fitted to regression plot is the linear model.

The details of the variables in the data are below:

**Description**

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).  It is formatted as a data frame with 32 observations on 11 variables.

cyl ..... Number of cylinders [1] <br>
disp .... Displacement, in cubic inches <br>
hp ...... Gross horsepower <br>
drat .... Rear axle gear ratio <br>
wt ...... Weight, in thousands of pounds <br>
qsec .... Quarter-mile time, in seconds <br>
